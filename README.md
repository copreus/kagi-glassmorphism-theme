# Kagi Glassmorphism UI

A thoughtful adaptation of the [pdanzma/kagi-css](https://github.com/pdanzma/kagi-css) theme, focusing on (somewhat) preserving the beautiful glassmorphism UI while implementing critical fixes. This version aims to maintain the essence of the original design while addressing specific functionality issues.
